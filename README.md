# Pyrcade - Python Terminal Based "Game Engine"
### What is this?
This is a Python "Game Engine", it uses the terminal to output video and uses many libraries to make things like listen to the keyboard input, have good "video memory" management and other things. Started just for fun way to pass the time, all while I learned more about python and how it works

### 2 Engine versions on the repository
The .old.py engine is the prototype engine, not very good and I'm not very proud of it. The Pyrcade.py file is the new class based engine, the new and improved version of it.

#### *Arcade.old.py*
The Prototype engine, works with global variables and functions, is effective but hard to work in if implementing a new game. The mainloops are messy and confusing, the sprite implementation is hard to work with, the input is handled per game, not globally, and more problems

#### *Pyrcade.py*
The new **class based** engine, the **class based** tag is because I've never coded with classes (very easy to do, and I've never done it 'till now). Cleaner, easier to work in, more understandable, easier to debug in, there are just many advantages comparing it to the old one.

### Examples
The engine includes some example games to try out

#### Tetris (Python)
A recreation of __Tetris__ using the __Pyrcade Engine__ and __Python__, it is very similar to other Tetris versions and runs perfectly on within the temrinal, by importing `pyrcade_engine` into the __Tetris__ file we have the engine working as expected, and we separate the games from the engine (Unlike the `arcade.old.py` engine)

#### Tetris (Pyrcade Script)
