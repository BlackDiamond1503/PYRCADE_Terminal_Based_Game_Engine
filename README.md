# Pyrcade - Python Terminal Based "Game Engine"
### What is this?
This is a Python "Game Engine", it uses the terminal to output video and uses many libraries to make things like listen to the keyboard input, have good "video memory" management and other things. Started jut for fun ans to pass the time, all while I learned more about python and how it works

### 2 Engine versions on the repository
The .old.py engine is the prototype engine, not very good and I'm not very proud of it. The Pyrcade.py file is the new class based engine, the new and improved version of it.

#### *Arcade.old.py*
The Prototype engine, works with global variables and functions, is effective but hard to work in if implementing a new game. The mainloops are messy and confusing, the sprite implementation is hard to work with, the input is handled per game, not globally, and more problems

#### *Pyrcade.py*
The new class based engine, the class based tag is becouse I've never coded with classes (very easy to do, and I've never done it 'till now). Cleaner, easier to work in, more understandable, easier to debug in, there are just many advantages comparing it to the old one.
