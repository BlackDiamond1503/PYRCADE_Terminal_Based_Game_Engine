# Pyrcade - Python Terminal Based "Game Engine"
## What is this?
This is a Python "Game Engine", it uses the terminal to output video and uses many libraries to make things like listen to the keyboard input, have good "video memory" management and other things. Started jut for fun ans to pass the time, all while I learned more about python and how it works

## 2 Engine versions on the repository
The .old.py engine is the prototype engine, not very good and I'm not very proud of it. The Pyrcade.py file is the new class based engine, the new and improved version of it.
